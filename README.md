# SpenditFrontEnd

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.6.
For the FrontEnd:

The Angular is based on the MVVM architecture and so we have also 3 main component
  -Views: Components that are responsible for rendering the UI
  -Services: Responsible for sending requests to the BackEnd
  -Models: Represents the abstraction of the real-world entities
  -Each View has its corresponding TypeScript file where we can manage the input data and use the different services

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
